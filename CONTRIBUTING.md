   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Tyronemitchell123/SuggestlyG4Plus.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Python Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install black isort flake8 mypy bandit pytest pytest-cov
   ```

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Configure your environment variables as needed

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the main application
python ai_agent_system.py

# Run the web interface (if applicable)
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Help us maintain code quality and reliability
- **Feature enhancements** - Add new capabilities to the platform
- **Documentation improvements** - Keep our docs clear and up-to-date
- **Performance optimizations** - Make the system faster and more efficient
- **Security improvements** - Help us maintain a secure platform
- **Test coverage** - Improve our testing infrastructure

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for related issues or feature requests
2. **Create an issue** - If none exists, create one to discuss your contribution
3. **Get approval** - Wait for maintainer feedback before starting large changes
4. **Stay updated** - Sync with upstream regularly to avoid conflicts

## Code Style and Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 127 characters maximum
- **Import organization**: Use `isort` for consistent import ordering
- **Code formatting**: Use `black` for consistent formatting
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for all public functions and methods

### Code Quality Tools

Before submitting, ensure your code passes:

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Lint code
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy . --ignore-missing-imports

# Security scan
bandit -r .
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript (if applicable)

- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- All new features must include comprehensive tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage on new code
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test files
pytest tests/test_specific_module.py
```

### Test Types

- **Unit tests** - Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests** - Test component interactions
- **End-to-end tests** - Test complete user workflows
- **Security tests** - Validate security measures

## Security Considerations

### Security Best Practices

- **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **Validate all inputs** - Sanitize and validate user inputs
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** - Implement secure coding practices
- **Regular dependency updates** - Keep dependencies current via Dependabot

### Security Review Process

- All security-related changes require maintainer review
- Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately via email to security@suggestlyg4plus.io
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch** with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run the full test suite** and ensure all checks pass

3. **Update documentation** if your changes affect user-facing functionality

### PR Requirements

- **Clear title and description** - Explain what and why
- **Reference related issues** - Use "Closes #123" syntax
- **Small, focused changes** - Keep PRs manageable in size
- **Pass all CI checks** - Ensure all automated checks pass
- **Get required reviews** - Wait for maintainer approval

### PR Template

Use our PR template to ensure you provide all necessary information:

- Description of changes
- Type of change (bug fix, feature, etc.)
- Testing performed
- Checklist completion

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem

- `release/*` - Release preparation branches
- `feature/*` - New feature development
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example:
```

Implements advanced NLP processing for more accurate responses.
Improves response quality by 15% in user testing.

Closes #123
```

## Release Process

### Version Management

We use semantic versioning (SemVer):
- **MAJOR** - Breaking changes
- **MINOR** - New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** - Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Schedule

- **Regular releases** - Monthly minor releases
- **Patch releases** - As needed for critical fixes
- **Major releases** - Quarterly or as significant features warrant
