## Accessibility

SuggestlyG4Plus is built to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, ensuring an inclusive experience for all users.

### Key Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are fully accessible via keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Escape)
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic HTML structure with ARIA labels and landmarks
- **Focus Indicators**: High-contrast focus rings with 3:1 minimum contrast ratio
- **Form Labels**: All form inputs are properly labeled and associated with their controls
- **Status Messages**: Dynamic content updates are announced to assistive technology via aria-live regions
- **Skip Links**: Allow keyboard users to quickly navigate to main content

### Navigation Conventions

- **Tab**: Move forward through interactive elements
- **Shift+Tab**: Move backward through interactive elements  
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and links
- **Escape**: Close modals and dropdown menus

### Adding Accessibility to New Components

When creating new interactive components:

1. **Use semantic HTML elements** (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`, etc.) instead of styled `<div>` elements
2. **Add proper labels**: Use `htmlFor` attributes on labels that match input `id` values
3. **Include ARIA attributes** when needed:
   - `aria-label` for buttons without visible text
   - `aria-expanded` for collapsible content
   - `aria-live` for dynamic status messages
4. **Ensure keyboard accessibility**: All interactive elements should be reachable and operable via keyboard
5. **Maintain color contrast**: Text should have at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio (3:1 for large text)
